The setup joints (passive arms) are now fully motorized and computer controlled, with automatic positioning and gravity compensation.  Instead of four long setup arms starting from a central column, the patient's cart now has a main boom that allows to position all 4 arms above the patient.  Each active arm can then be positioned precisely with much shorter setup arms.  The setup is the OR is simpler and the kinematic chains shorter (likely more precise).\n\n An extra degree of freedom is provided on the setup joints to reposition the active arm without changing the RCM point.  This degree of freedom is not active during teleoperation, its main function is to place the arms away from each other and avoid collicions outside the patient.The Xi system also introduces a motorized table which allows to incline the patient while the instruments are in place.  This requires the setup joints to be motorized so the entry points (RCM) can follow the table's motion.\n\nThe patient cart has motorized wheels to ease transport between rooms.\n\nThe patient's side active arms (both holding instruments: PSMs and the endoscope: ECM) are interchangeable and renamed USMs (Universal serial manipulators).  Each arm can now hold either an instrument or the endoscope.  Each USM now has 8 motors, providing 5 actuators for the instrument itself (previous versions had 4).  All motors and sensors for the instrument's actuation are located on the insertion link, directly behind the sterile adapter.  Previous systems had complex cables and pulleys from the motors in the second link of the active arm to the back of the sterile adapter.\n\nThe video system is totally new, with a fully digital HD 3D video stream from the endoscope tip to the surgeon's console.\n\nThe surgeon's console remains visually unchanged from the da Vinci Si and SP."

    "description": "Original da Vinci system, first generation, aka IS 1000.  Designed in the late 20th century, it is a teleoperation based system for RAMIS (robotically assisted minimally invasive surgery).  The patient side manipulators always follow the surgeon's movements, there is no automomy whatsoever.\n\n    All the patient's side robotic arms (PSMs and ECM) have a mechanical remote center of motion (RCM) using a parallel linkage. The active arms holding the instruments (PSMs) are mechanically gravity compensated, they are light and don't require brakes.  In case of power failure, they won't drop in the patient.  These arms are cable driven and quite impressive from a mechanical point of view.  Instruments have wristed end effectors and can be swapped.  The camera manipulator (ECM) is not gravity compensated and requires brakes.\n\n    The patient cart has long passive arms (setup joints) that are gravity compensated except for the last joint (roll).  These setup joints or passive arms are designed to hold the active arms RCM points The da Vinci intially came with one camera arm (ECM) and two patient side manipulators (PSMs). A third PSM was later added (IS 1200).  The setup joints for the third PSM is tacked under the ECM ones and are not gravity compensated, clearly an afterthought.\n\n     The video system uses fiber optic bundles for the stereo images and light in the endoscope. CCD sensors are located in the camera head.  Focus is mechanical.\n\n  The surgeon's console uses a stereoscopic viewer with two CRT monitors (640x480) and mirrors.  The surgeon's console includes two master manipulators (aka 3D joysticks or haptic devices).  These robotic arms arr counter balanced and have 7 degrees of freedom to ensure a larger workspace, specially for the hand's orientation (SO3).  The MTMs are motorized.  These motors are used to add software based gravity compensation but can also provide some haptic feedback.  The feedback is based on the model (joint limits on PSMs) and/or the current teleoperation task (instruments vs camera teleoperation).  It is not based on forces measured on the patient side so the system doesn't provide *force feedback* per say.\n\n    This generation introduced the core features of most current RAMIS systems: 3D vision, remote center of motion, wristed instruments, hand-eye registration, motion scaling, clutching, ECM bimanual teleoperation, remote and ergonomic console, interchangeable instruments sterile adpaters between the instruments or endoscopes and the patient cart...",

    "description": "Haptic device.  First 3 dofs are motorized for force feedback, last 3 dofs are passive.  Rotational space is represented using a spherical joint which allows for unlimited rotations.  The trick is to use an IMU-like sensor to track the handle orientation instead of using rotary encoders which would require cable management for unlimited rotation.  Stylus comes in different shapes, the default is a pen-like handle with a couple of buttons."
